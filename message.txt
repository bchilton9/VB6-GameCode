Got a whole lot of new maps in, fixed some of the existing ones to look better. Feel free to explore around. Also fixed a bug in the map creation system. Music is now in, just not hooked up to the maps. THat will be in the next update. Also fixed a few other minor bugs. Enjoy! Just upzip the files in the update zip. Overwrite the map file with the one in the data directory, and overwrite the RoW.exe with the existing one.
